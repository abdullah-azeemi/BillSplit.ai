# ðŸ§¾ BillSplit.AI

BillSplit.AI is a smart, mobile-friendly app that helps groups split bills fairly using AI. Users can upload photos of receipts, and the app uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract items, prices, and totals. It can also answer natural language questions about the receipt and suggest fair splits.

  - Parse items, prices, and totals
  - Answer questions like "Who ordered what?" or "What's the total?"
- ðŸ‘¥ Add group members and assign items
- ðŸ’¸ Calculate and show a fair split (equal or item-based)
- ðŸ“± Mobile-responsive frontend (built in Next.js)
